Codename: Roadtrip
===============

Roadtrip is a way to explore layers of content in photos. It's a project of [#SNDMakes](http://www.snd.org/2015/02/sndmakes-at-snddc-how-might-we-better-tell-picture-stories/), a protoyping session in Washington, D.C.

**This project is in the early alpha stage (in other words, I wouldn't use this for anything important).**

## Why we're making it

We want readers to be able to graphically peel back the layers of a photo (or series of photos).

## How to deploy it locally

Coming soon.

## How to push it to the cloud

Coming soon.
